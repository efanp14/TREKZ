BRANDING POLICY

All trademarks, service marks, logos, and trade names (collectively, "Marks") displayed in this project—including but not limited to the project name, logo, wordmarks, stylized graphics, and any other identifying symbols—are the sole property of their respective owners.

Usage Restrictions

You may not copy, reproduce, distribute, modify, alter, or create derivative works of the Marks in any form without the prior written permission of the trademark owner.

You may reference the project name in text to accurately describe the project (for example, in documentation, reviews, or articles), provided you do not imply endorsement, sponsorship, or affiliation by the trademark owner.

Use of the Marks in any commercial offerings, promotional materials, merchandise, or product packaging requires a separate trademark license obtained in writing from the trademark owner.

Any unauthorized use of the Marks may constitute trademark infringement and subject the infringing party to legal action.
