# Build a TripTales Travel Social Map Web Application
Create a full-stack travel social map application called "TripTales" where users can create, share, and discover travel experiences through interactive maps and visual storytelling.
## Core Features
1. Interactive map interface using Mapbox
2. Trip creation with multiple location pins
3. Photo uploads for each location
4. Trip timeline visualization
5. Public trip sharing and discovery
6. Trending trips section
## Technical Requirements
### Backend (Node.js with Express)
- Implement a RESTful API
- Create an in-memory storage system for development (no database required)
- Include a default test user - no authentication system needed
### Frontend (React)
- Modern React with hooks
- Map integration with Mapbox GL JS
- TanStack Query for data fetching
- React Hook Form for form management
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn UI components
### Data Models
- Users: Basic profile info (name, username, bio)
- Trips: Title, summary, dates, visibility settings
- Pins: Location data, photos, descriptions, order in trip
### Routes & Endpoints
- `/api/trips` - CRUD operations for trips
- `/api/pins` - CRUD operations for pins
- `/api/trending` - Get trending trips
- `/api/auth/me` - Get current user (simplified to always return default user)
### Simplified Authentication
- Create a default test user
- No login/signup screens needed
- All requests use the default user
### Map Integration
- Interactive Mapbox maps
- Pin placement on maps
- Route visualization between pins
- Custom pin styling
### Design Requirements
- Clean, modern UI with Tailwind
- Mobile-responsive design
- Blue color scheme
- Trip cards with preview images
### Project Structure
- Clear separation of client and server code
- Component-based architecture
- Shared type definitions for client and server
Development should focus on core functionality first, with authentication being simplified to a single default user to accelerate development.
